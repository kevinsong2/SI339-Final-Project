    <h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am currently studying at the University of Michigan, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Analysis with a minor in computer science. I hope to use my background in statistics and ML to analyze data to tell stories and develop software to solve real world problems in sports and healthcare.<br>

    <h2>Why Information?</h2>
	<p>Starting off as a young first year student, I had no idea of what I wanted to study. All I knew was faint interests in math and code but no major was a passion to me. Finally at the University of Michigan, I found out about the School of Information IA path which focuses on the intersections of big data, coding, and applying them to real-life situations which perfectly alignes with my interests.<br>
